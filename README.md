# IEEE Companion notebooks

## Installing the dependencies
The easiest way to get all the dependencies is to run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using conda, you probably want to install `scikit-learn` using conda. 

For PyTorch and torchvision, you can install them using conda by running:
```
conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision
```
